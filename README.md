#Large Scale Machine Learning Library.

LIBSML is a large-scale machine learning library. Its goal is to make practical machine learning scalable and easy.
It consists of common learning models, including logistic regression, linear supporting vector machine,
K-Means, collaborative filtering, as well as effective optimization methods, including L-BFGS, TRON, SGD, FTRL.

##Building LIBSML

LIBSML is built using Apache Maven. To build LIBSML, run

    mvn -DskipTests clean package

##Examples

The following code illustrates how to load a sample dataset, split it into train and test, and use optimization method to
to fit a machine learning model, such as logistic regression, linear supporting vector machine.
Then the model is evaluated against the test dataset and saved to disk.

```scala
import com.github.libsml.model.classification.LogisticRegressionModel
import com.github.libsml.model.classification.{LogisticRegression, LogisticRegressionModel}
import com.github.libsml.math.linalg.Vector
import com.github.libsml.model.data.DataUtils
import com.github.libsml.model.evaluation.{BinaryDefaultEvaluator, SingleBinaryClassificationMetrics}
import com.github.libsml.model.regularization.{L1Regularization, L2Regularization}
import com.github.libsml.optimization.lbfgs.LBFGS
import com.github.libsml.optimization.liblinear.{LiblinearParameter, Tron}
import com.github.libsml.math.function.Function._
```

##[Distributed L-BFGS](https://github.com/libsml/libsml/tree/master/libsml-lbfgs)

A distributed implemention of L-BFGS, supporting L1-regularization, L2-regularization and three modes(local, mr and spark) to train/test a model.

##[Distributed liblinear](https://github.com/libsml/libsml/tree/master/libsml-liblinear)

A distributed implemention of liblinear, supporting TRON and three modes(local, mr and spark) to train/test a model.
