Scalable Machine Learning Library.
==================================
  A scalable machine learning library, including distributed L-BFGS, distributed liblinear, etc.

[Distributed L-BFGS](https://github.com/libsml/libsml/tree/master/libsml-lbfgs)
-----------------------------------
A distributed implemention of L-BFGS, supporting L1-regularization, L2-regularization and three modes(local, mr and spark) to train/test a model.


[Distributed liblinear](https://github.com/libsml/libsml/tree/master/libsml-liblinear)
-----------------------------------
A distributed implemention of liblinear, supporting TRON and three modes(local, mr and spark) to train/test a model.
