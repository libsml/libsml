Large Scale Machine Learning Library.
==================================
LIBSML is a large-scale machine learning library. Now it supports distributed models such as logistic regression, linear support vector machines, etc, and distributed optimization methods such as L-BFGS, TRON, ADMM.

[Distributed L-BFGS](https://github.com/libsml/libsml/tree/master/libsml-lbfgs)
-----------------------------------
A distributed implemention of L-BFGS, supporting L1-regularization, L2-regularization and three modes(local, mr and spark) to train/test a model.

[Distributed liblinear](https://github.com/libsml/libsml/tree/master/libsml-liblinear)
-----------------------------------
A distributed implemention of liblinear, supporting TRON and three modes(local, mr and spark) to train/test a model.
